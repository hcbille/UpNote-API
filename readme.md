## Info:
This project is to add API functionality to UpNote since it's currently lacking. 
It uses an Android device as the API gateway with Termux as the software setup.


## Prereq:
1. An Android device - preferably a device that does not require batteries since it will be on 24/7. I use a first-gen MiBox.
2. Install [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) and [Termux:Boot](https://github.com/termux/termux-boot) and UpNote. I downloaded Termux and Termux:Boot from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and UpNote from [Aurora](https://auroraoss.com/) since it's not compatible with my device on Google Play.

## Install:
1. Clone the project.
2. Run "install.sh" to copy files from boot/ to .termux/boot to make the project and ssh autorun.
3. run "runMe.sh" to start the API
